Just See SAW!

Wow. The critics weren't wrong. Not since seven has horror been portrayed so majestically.  From the first minute to last this film twists and turns you till you feel rather poorly. Just like 'Se7en', the all-round Grittiness that director James Wan creates disgusts and enthralls. Just like 'Se7en', there is a H U G E twist that makes your blood curdle.  A lack of star names helps the movie flow as the pace builds to a finale that won't be forgotten by this viewer in a hurry!  I still can't sleep.  It is well scripted, well acted, and, for everyone who guesses the killer after the first few minutes, keeps you guessing right up to the final reel. It is better than Seven for shock value. It is not over the top gory but there is a final scene which makes you sweat.  Very highly recommended!
